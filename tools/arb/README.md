# ARENA AR Builder
An AR/VR capable editing tool to create/manipulate/delete ARENA objects.

## Requirements
See top-level python documentation for [Python requirements](https://github.com/conix-center/arena-py). This tool uses the [ARENA Persistence Database](https://github.com/conix-center/arena-persist), so all changes are persisted.
