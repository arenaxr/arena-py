# Shows two programs interacting with the same object. Program 1 will create
# a clickable object with random id and color. Program 2 will print the id and
# color for the object when the object is clicked.
#
# This simulates interacting with multiple clients, some may generate objects
# persisting in the scene, which others may later need to interact with.
