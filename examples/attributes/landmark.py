"""Landmark

Creates a landmark that can be teleported to from the UI list, or is one of the random starting positions for the scene.

Define entities as a landmark; Landmarks appears in the landmark list and you can move (teleport) to them; You can define the behavior of the teleport: if you will be at a fixed or random distance, looking at the landmark, fixed offset or if it is constrained by a navmesh (when it exists).
