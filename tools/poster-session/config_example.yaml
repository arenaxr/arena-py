# ** Scene layout definitions **
# Configure the layouts for each scene
# layout: the layout of the walls; one of:
#      ROWCOL - arrange walls in rows and columns; parameters:
#               row_dist=30: distance between rows
#               col_dist=30: distance between cols
#               row_off=0: where rows start (offset from 0)
#               col_off=0: where cols start (offset from 0)
#               col_dir=1: direction of cols (1 or -1)
#               row_dir=-1: direction of rows (1 or -1)
#               col_axis='x': which axis is used as the col axis
#               row_axis='z': which axis is used as the row axis
#               fixed_axis='y': axis that defines the plane where the walls are laid out
#      CIRCLE - arrange in a circle; parameters:
#               radius=50: radius of the circle (will try to layout the walls evenly spaced)
#               a1_off=0: center of the circle offset from 0 in axis 1 (see axis1 param)
#               a2_off=0: center of the circle offset from 0 in axis 2 (see axis2 param)
#               axis1='x': which axis is used as axis1
#               axis2='z': which axis is used as axis2
#               fixed_axis='y': defines the plane where the walls are laid out
#      SQUARE - arange walls in a square shape; parameters:
#               length=50: length of the square (will try to layout the walls evenly spaced)
#               a1_off=0: offset of the corner of the square from 0 in axis 1 (see axis1 param)
#               a2_off=0: offset of the corner of the square from 0 in axis 2 (see axis2 param)
#               axis1='x': which axis is used as axis1
#               axis2='z': which axis is used as axis2
#               fixed_axis='y': defines the plane where the walls are laid out
#      LINE - arrange walls in a line; parameters:
#               length=200: length of the line (will try to layout the walls evenly spaced)
#               rotation=90: rotation (degrees) of the wall
#               alternating_rot=True: alternating rotation to make the walls face each other in pairs (True/False)
#               a1_off=0: offset of the line start from 0 in axis 1 (see axis1 param)
#               a2_off=0: offset of the line start from 0 in axis 2 (see axis2 param)
#               axis1='x': which axis is used as axis1
#               axis2='z': which axis is used as axis2
#               fixed_axis='y': defines the plane where the walls are laid out
